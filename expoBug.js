This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and it's related to the way Expo manages dependencies and assets.  The underlying cause might be a corrupted cache, incorrect package configurations, or conflicts between different versions of Expo modules. The error message itself is usually not very informative, only reporting a general failure during the build or start process. It may manifest as a cryptic error message or the build process failing without clear indication of the root problem.
