# Expo CLI Cryptic Build/Start Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error manifests as a build or start failure without providing a clear and actionable error message. This is often due to underlying issues with dependency management, asset handling, or a corrupted Expo cache.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.  Observe that the build/start process will unexpectedly fail without providing a detailed error message.

## Solution

The solution involves systematically addressing potential issues.  This includes: 

- Clearing the Expo cache: `expo start --clear` 
- Checking package.json for dependency conflicts.
- Ensuring that all dependencies are compatible with the Expo version.
- Deleting the node_modules folder and reinstalling dependencies:
   - `rm -rf node_modules`
   - `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Checking for any issues with assets. Make sure the assets are correctly configured and accessible.
- Finally, upgrading Expo and related packages to the latest versions might also help.
