// This file doesn't contain the specific bug code, but demonstrates a solution approach.

// 1. Clear the Expo cache:
expo start --clear

// 2. Check and fix package.json for dependency conflicts or incompatible versions.
// 3. Delete node_modules and reinstall:
rm -rf node_modules
npm install // or yarn install
